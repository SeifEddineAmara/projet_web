    INGREDIENTS:
    4 large courgettes, trimmed
    Olive oil, for frying
    Grated Parmesan cheese, to serve (optional)
    FOR THE MEATBALLS<br>

    500g lean turkey mince
    1 small onion, peeled and very finely chopped
    2 garlic cloves, peeled and very finely chopped
    2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
    1 egg, beaten
    Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
    FOR THE TOMATO SAUCE<br>

    Olive oil, for frying
    1 onion, peeled and diced
    2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
    1 tbsp tomato purée
    2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes
    ½ tsp dried oregano
    ½ tsp balsamic vinegar<br>

    COOKING INSTRUCTIONS :

    1- Using a spiralizer, julienne peeler or mandolin, turn the 4 courgettes into spaghetti. Put to one side until ready to cook.<br>
    2- Put the turkey mince into a mixing bowl with the chopped onion, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, beaten egg and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Mix everything together until thoroughly combined.<br>
    3- With wet hands, roll the mixture into 20 meatballs and put them on to a plate. Cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.<br>
    4- Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Place a large frying pan over a medium heat and add a dash of olive oil. Once hot, add the onion and sauté for 5–6 minutes until soft, then add the garlic and cook for a further minute.<br>
    5- Stir in the tomato purée and continue to cook for 2 minutes, then add the chopped tomatoes, oregano, balsamic vinegar and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Stir everything together and leave to simmer for 10 minutes, until slightly thickened.<br>
    6- To cook the meatballs, place a frying pan over a medium heat and add a dash of oil. Once hot, brown the meatballs in batches, turning frequently so they colour on all sides. Transfer to the pan with the tomato sauce to cook for a further 10 minutes until cooked through, turning from time to time. (If the sauce becomes too thick, add 50–100ml of water.)<br>
    7- Add an extra teaspoon of oil to the frying pan the meatballs were browned in and gently sauté the courgette spaghetti over a medium heat, tossing occasionally, for 3–5 minutes, until soft but with a slight bite.<br>
    8- Divide the courgette spaghetti between serving bowls and top with the meatballs. Sprinkle with Parmesan, if using.<br>
